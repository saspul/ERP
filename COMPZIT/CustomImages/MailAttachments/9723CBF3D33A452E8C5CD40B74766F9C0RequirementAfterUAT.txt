EMPLOYEE MASTER

Font to be changed for the "Alert Message' nearby fields such as "valid email.." etc.

No notification to employee with their username and password. This should be done.

Avoid Page Refreshing while selecting designation, Corporate Office.
Telephone number should accept international format. Not able to add numbers with Qatar Code. IF we can auto embed the country code on selecting the country, it will be really good
A button or link to jump to view Listing Page (eg: Corporate Pack Listing) will be good. Else we will need to press Cancel. Just a thought.
I am able to double click the submit button and then it shows there is a duplicate entry because the first click inserts the required entry. Should we disable this?

DESIGNATION MASTER

If the designation type doesn’t have the user role specified, a text saying, no role listed would be good. When we choose Department Group Manager, and click on User Role, it feels like something is not loading
Refreshing to be avoided while user selects Designation Type.

UNREGISTERED USER

No option to reset password; we will send a mail while approval. User name will also include in this notification mail. There will be a 'Forgot Password' link in the notification mail.

ORGANIZATION MAIL VERIFICATION

On confirmation of the company by admin, there is no notification to the registered user. One email with those details will be good. Also it would be good if we can include the username at least in this email, because after this, I tried logging in, it is saying wrong username / password. No way to confirm if its by email or something else
No need to ask Registered Email ID, if an organization trying to verify their registration.
